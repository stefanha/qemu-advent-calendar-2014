            <title>Day 14 - Multiboot "Invaders"</title>
            <link>http://www.qemu-advent-calendar.org/#day-14</link>

	    <description>The Multiboot boot sequence is supported by the GRUB bootloaders and QEMU as a way to standardize common mechanisms like kernel command-lines, modules/initrd, x86 protected mode, and graphics mode at startup.  This little spaceship game is implemented as a Multiboot-compliant binary so it can be loaded directly by QEMU.</description>

            <guid>http://www.qemu-advent-calendar.org/#day-7</guid>
	    <description>The venerable MINIX operating system has conquered x86 and ARM platforms with microkernel goodness. Famous for isolating and running operating system components in separate processes so the system can survive failures, MINIX 3 takes pieces from NetBSD userspace so it feels like UNIX - just unstoppable and about to take over the world!</description>

            <title>Day 5 - 64-bit ARM has landed</title>

	    <description>QEMU is the first open source emulator with 64-bit ARM support (also known as aarch64). That's right, QEMU doesn't just emulate old hardware, it emulates hardware you may not even own yet! But if you think 32 bits ought to be enough for anyone, just collect your bragging rights for playing tetris-bsd on a bleeding edge hardware architecture.</description>
